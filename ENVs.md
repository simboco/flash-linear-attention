# FLA Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FLA_NO_USE_TMA` | `0` | `0` or `1` | Set to `1` to disable Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) on Hopper or Blackwell GPUs. |
| `FLA_CONV_BACKEND` | `cuda` | `triton` or `cuda` | Choose the convolution backend. `cuda` is the default and preferred for most cases. |
| `FLA_USE_FAST_OPS` | `0` | `0` or `1` | Enable faster, but potentially less accurate, operations when set to `1`. |
| `FLA_TRIL_PRECISION` | `ieee` | `ieee`, `tf32`, `tf32x3` | Controls the precision for triangular operations. `tf32x3` is only available on NV GPUs. |
